## My Process

## My Experience with Prisma

ðŸš€

Getting `Prisma` up and running for the first time can be a bit **challenging**, just like with any database. However, whatâ€™s great about Prisma is how **quickly** I can set it up without needing to open another app, like with MongoDB. I **highly** recommend it!

One of the best things about Prisma is its seamless integration into my workflow. Unlike MongoDB, which often requires additional tools or interfaces, Prisma provides a **unified solution** that allows me to manage my database directly within my project. This makes development much more **efficient** and **time-saving**.

### What I Learned

ðŸŽ¯

- Setting up Prisma with Next.js and PostgreSQL
- Using Prisma Migrate for database schema changes
- Efficient querying with Prisma Client

### Continued Development

ðŸ”¥

For my future projects, I plan to switch to **PostgreSQL** to take full advantage of its **advanced types and scalability features**. Additionally, I aim to improve my proficiency with my tech stack as a whole, since I'll be working on numerous **personal and career-based projects**.

### My Tech Stack

ðŸ’¡

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **Styling & UI:** Tailwind CSS with Shadcn, Daisy UI, Framer Motion, Magic UI
- **Backend & Database:** Prisma, PostgreSQL
- **Testing & Validation:** Vitest, Jest, Testing Library, Zod

Staying consistent and improving my skills with these technologies is my top priority! ðŸš€
